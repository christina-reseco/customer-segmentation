The goal is to segment credit card customers into similar groups based on customer characteristics/features provided in the customer dataset. 
K-means algorithm is used to segment the overall pool of customers into several groups that share common characteristics. 

The data analysis and modeling below covers the following steps:
•	Data analysis/discovery
•	Data preparation for modeling: scaling/normalization
•	Selection of the number of clusters (customer segments)
•	Modeling data by K-Means
•	Interpretation and visualization of results (customer segment characteristics)
